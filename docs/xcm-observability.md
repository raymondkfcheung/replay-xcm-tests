# 🔭 XCM Observability

When sending XCMs using `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` or other calls from the  `PolkadotXcm` pallet, two observability features help trace and correlate messages across chains:

* [`SetTopic([u8; 32])`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/staging_xcm/v5/opaque/type.Instruction.html#variant.SetTopic) - An XCM instruction that sets the Topic Register. This 32-byte array is used as the `message_id`, which appears in both `Sent` and `Processed` events. The topic enables logical grouping or filtering of related XCMs across multiple hops.
  > ⚠️ **Note**: The topic is **not guaranteed to be unique**. If uniqueness is required (e.g. for deduplication or tracing), it must be enforced by the message creator.
* **`message_id`** - A hash emitted in both the[`PolkadotXcm.Sent`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_xcm/pallet/enum.Event.html#variant.Sent) event (on the origin chain) and the [`MessageQueue.Processed`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_message_queue/pallet/enum.Event.html#variant.Processed) event (on the destination chain). While this ID is not globally unique, it **suffices to correlate a `Sent` message with its matching `Processed` result**.

## 🔄 Message Lifecycle

### ▶️ Execute Sample Script

Assuming you're familiar with how to replay a forked chain using [Chopsticks](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/). If not, refer to the [guide](../README.md) for setup instructions.

* [`limited-reserve-transfer-assets.ts`](../src/limited-reserve-transfer-assets.ts)

```bash
npx ts-node src/limited-reserve-transfer-assets.ts
```

### ✅ Local XCM (on origin chain - e.g., Polkadot Asset Hub)

```json
{
  "type": "TransferAsset",
  "value": {
    "assets": [...],
    "beneficiary": {...}
  }
}
```

### 🚀 Forwarded XCM (to destination - e.g., Acala)

The runtime automatically appends a `SetTopic`:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "ReserveAssetDeposited",
    "value": [...]
  },
  {
    "type": "ClearOrigin"
  },
  {
    "type": "BuyExecution",
    "value": {...}
  },
  {
    "type": "DepositAsset",
    "value": {...}
  },
  {
    "type": "SetTopic",
    "value": "0x85e46e75d9dbb211da2fb28106028960fdd916fbe9fdda3665ae00403abe2aae"
  }
]
```

This forwarded message lands on the destination chain (Acala) and is processed accordingly.

### 🔍 Event Correlation Flow

| Chain              | Event                   | Field        | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Polkadot Asset Hub | `PolkadotXcm.Sent`      | `message_id` | Message ID derived from `SetTopic`                  |
| Acala              | `MessageQueue.Processed`| `id`         | Should match the `message_id` from the origin chain |

## 🧠 Notes

* `SetTopic` is always **appended as the final instruction** in the XCM by the runtime.
* You do **not** need to include `SetTopic` manually when using standard extrinsics like `limited_reserve_transfer_assets`. The runtime handles this automatically.
* If you construct and submit XCMs manually using `execute`, you **can specify your own `SetTopic`** to group or identify messages logically.
* For testing or tracing, you may **inject a custom topic** by adding a `SetTopic([u8; 32])` instruction yourself. This is especially useful when crafting raw XCMs.
