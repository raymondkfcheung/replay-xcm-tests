# Replay XCMs Using Chopsticks

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) is a tool for forking live Polkadot SDK-based chains in a local environment. If you're new to it, check out the [Get Started](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/toolkit/parachains/fork-chains/chopsticks/get-started/) guide.

This tutorial focuses specifically on replaying [XCMs](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/), a powerful technique for:

* [Debugging cross-chain message failures](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/test-and-debug/)
* Tracing execution across relay chains and parachains
* Analysing weight usage, error types, and message flow
